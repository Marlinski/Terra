 *     core. They only have access to the ExtensionManager to register their new blocks.</li>
 *
 *     <li>Convergence Layer Adapter Module: this class of module provides new convergence layer
 *     adapter. They have no access to the core and only implements the CLA contract. </li>
 *

 *     unrestricted access to all the core components.</li>
 * </ul>
